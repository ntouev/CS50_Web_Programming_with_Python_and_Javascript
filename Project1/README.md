# Project 1: Books

## Objectives

* Become more comfortable with Python.
* Gain experience with Flask.
* Learn to use SQL to interact with databases.


## Overview

In this project, you’ll build a book review website. Users will be able to register for your website and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they will be able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. You’ll also use the a third-party API by Goodreads, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. Finally, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via your website’s API.  

## PostgreSQL

In file database.sql are instructions about installing and configuring a database.  

## Run

First, you should register for Goodreads in order to get an API_KEY to place in function
def book(user_name, book_title) in application.py file.  

Make sure to have python3, pip3 and virtualenv installed.  

Fill in your database's info in the conf file.

To run do:

* $ chmod +x ./requirements  
* $ chmod +x ./run_server  
* $ ./requirements  
* $ ./run_server  

## Requirements of your website

* Registration: Users should be able to register for your website, providing a username and password.
* Login: Users, once registered, should be able to log in to your website with their username and password.
* Logout: Logged in users should be able to log out of the site.
* Import: Provided for you in this project is a file called books.csv, which is a spreadsheet in CSV format of 5000 different books. Each one has an ISBN number, a title, an author, and a publication year. In a Python file called import.py separate from your web application, write a program that will take the books and import them into your PostgreSQL database. You will first need to decide what table(s) to create, what columns those tables should have, and how they should relate to one another. Run this program by running python3 import.py to import the books into your database.
* Search: Once a user has logged in, they should be taken to a page where they can search for a book. Users should be able to type in the ISBN number of a book. After performing the search, your website should display a list of possible matching results. If the user typed in only part of an ISBN your search page should find matches for those as well!
* Book Page: When users click on a book from the results of the search page, they should be taken to a book page, with details about the book: its title, author, publication year, ISBN number, and any reviews that users have left for the book on your website.
* Review Submission: On the book page, users should be able to submit a review: consisting of a rating on a scale of 1 to 5, as well as a text component to the review where the user can write their opinion about a book.
* Goodreads Review Data: On your book page, you should also display (if available) the average rating and number of ratings the work has received from Goodreads.
* API Access: If users make a GET request to your website’s /api/<isbn> route, where <isbn> is an ISBN number, your website should return a JSON response containing the book’s title, author, publication date, ISBN number, review count, and average score. The resulting JSON should follow the format:  


    {
        "title": "Memory",
        "author": "Doug Lloyd",
        "year": 2015,
        "isbn": "1632168146",
        "review_count": 28,
        "average_score": 5.0
    }


If the requested ISBN number isn’t in your database, your website should return a 404 error.


You should be using raw SQL commands (as via SQLAlchemy’s execute method) in order to make database queries. You should not use the SQLAlchemy ORM (if familiar with it) for this project.
